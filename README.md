# AI Kill Switch

**The easiest way to add a kill switch to your AI service.**

A comprehensive Python SDK for implementing AI safety mechanisms, real-time monitoring, and kill switches. AI Kill Switch provides essential components out of the box, so developers can focus on building great AI features with confidence while ensuring users feel safe and trust the AI they rely on.

## Vision & Goals

**Our Vision**: To make it standard practice for every AI service to have its own kill switch. AI Kill Switch aims to become the default safety backbone for modern AI systems.

**User Experience Goals**:
- **Developers**: Stay focused on building great AI features with minimal integration effort
- **Operators**: Gain simple, powerful tools to keep AI safe and under control  
- **AI Service Users**: Feel confident knowing the AI they interact with is safe and trustworthy

See [docs/phylosophy/](docs/phylosophy/) for detailed vision and user experience goal documentation.
