# AI Kill Switch â€“ Vision

**Slogan:** *"The easiest way to add a kill switch to your AI service."*

## Why We Exist
An **AI Kill Switch is essential** for running safe and reliable AI services.  
Making a kill switch requires building an infrastructure to **observe AI action, detect risks, and take action**, and that takes significant effort.  
***AI Kill Switch* makes this simple**: we provide the essential components out of the box, so developers can focus on building great AI features with confidence.  
At the same time, *AI Kill Switch* ensures that the users of your service can feel safe and trust the AI they rely on.

## Our Philosophy

### 1. Runtime Safety First
- AI cannot be fully guaranteed by pre-deployment testing.  
- Runtime validation and control are essential for trust and reliability.  

### 2. Essential Components Provided
- We deliver the core infrastructure for AI kill switch.  
- Developers only need to add the domain-specific safety logic.  

### 3. Minimal by Design
- A few lines are enough to integrate.  
- Developer-friendly by default.  

### 4. Easy Domain-Specific Extensions
- Safety logic can be quickly defined and extended for each unique use case.  
- Flexible plugin architecture enables safe customization.  

### 5. Open by Default
- Fully open source to ensure transparency and trust.  
- Encourages contribution, sharing, and openness across developers.  

## Our Components
- **Kill Switch SDK**: A client library for observing AI behavior and sending events.  
- **Kill Switch Server**: A control plane for collecting data, applying safety logic, and executing actions.  
- **Safety Logic & Actions**: Extensible and reusable building blocks to detect risks and define responses.  
- **Dashboard & API**: Interfaces for real-time monitoring, safety management, and manual control.  

## Final Goal
To make it **standard practice for every AI service to have its own kill switch**.  
*AI Kill Switch* aims to become the **default safety backbone** for modern AI systems:

- Giving **developers** confidence  
- Giving **operators** control  
- Giving **users** peace of mind
